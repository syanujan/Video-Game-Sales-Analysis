# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
This project carries over the concepts I learned in my Data Science courses at uWaterloo into one single megaproject. 

Some of the concepts that will be explored include forecasting, machine learning, data visualization analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing.

More TBD.
